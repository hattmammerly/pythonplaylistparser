still haven't learned markdown

currently takes tracks from the itunes db and puts em in a dictionary
takes playlists and puts em in a dictionary as well

is a dict the most time/memory-efficient way to do this?

next: play with sorting and outputting into different playlist formats

then maybe some ncurses action
